# Lesson 2

## Using Git for Version Control
When we work on software we want to be able to save our work, share it with
others, and revert (undo) changes that we tried and don't want to keep. In
addition we would like to be able to test what we have done and share our work
in progress with other people so they can help us, help verify what we did, or
we can help them with something. In order to do that we will use a tool called
`git`. [GitHub](https://www.github.com) is a web based provider of Git but
there are others such as [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com) or you can host your
own server if you download one of the server packages or you can just run a
barebones server (that means that it doesn't have any additional features that
would be provided by running GitHub or GitLab free servers).

## Cloning a Project
For this project I am already using Git to modify and check in the material so
let's start by cloning the project that you're reading. Use your browser and go
to https://github.com/gcorsaw/python That's the URL of the project. You can see
that there are several files already present, tabs at the top of the screen,
and a green "Code" button that has a drop down arrow. Click the "Code" button,
select the "HTTPS" tab at the top of the pop-up window, and then click the two
overlapping boxes to copy the URL to the project.

Go to your Ubuntu terminal and to make sure you're in your home directory
execute `cd ~`. Type in `git clone ` (make sure you end with a space) and then
right click in the window to paste the URL that you just copied. The command
should look something like `git clone https://github.com/gcorsaw/python.git`.
If it does hit enter and clone the project from the server to your computer.
You may need to enter a user or password based on your setup. Let me know
when you do this and I'll help you.
